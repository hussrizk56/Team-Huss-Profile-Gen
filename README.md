## Description :
For this week's assignment I create a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. 


## Actions taken :
* Used Inquirer package to prompt the user with a series of questions (employee, emp ID, contact info, etc.) via the command-line interface. 
* Used the Jest package for running unit tests. 
* Used the "writefile" function to write the inputs onto a generated HTML. 
* Used bootstrap for basic styling, boxes/cards, web display.
